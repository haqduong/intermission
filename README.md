#intermission

intermission is a bit of [OpenResty](http://openresty.org) magic written in Lua to help you perform zero down time maintenance. At [37signals](http://37signals.com) we use this to perform application maintenance with limited/no impact to the user. In our use cases, we "hold" the users requests for less than 10 seconds while we do our database maintenance via [mysql\_role\_swap](https://github.com/37signals/mysql_role_swap/). The user sees a single long request, and things carry right along.

## Design Concepts
Put an incoming web request on hold long enough to do bad things behind the scenes. Release the incoming requests in the same order they were received. Has zero dependencies.

## Gotchas
Requests can only be paused as long the device sitting in front of it will allow. If you have [haproxy](haproxy.1wt.eu) deployed in front of your Nginx instance, make sure to check your "srvtimeout" values.

# Getting started

## Trying it Out (Local)

+ Run `vagrant up` (This will download the image, boot it, and compile and install openresty)
+ Run `vagrant ssh`
+ Run `tail -f /usr/local/openresty/nginx/logs/intermission-error.log`
+ Hit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (you should see google)
+ Hit [http://localhost:8080/_intermission/enable](http://localhost:8080/_intermission/enable).
+ Hit [http://localhost:8080/_intermission/status](http://localhost:8080/_intermission/status). (you should see "Pause Enabled")
+ Hit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) (you should see nothing)
+ Hit [http://localhost:8080/_intermission/disable](http://localhost:8080/_intermission/disable).
+ (Your request should have gone through now...)

## Advanced Usage

### Many Virtual Hosts

If you have many virtual hosts running on one nginx instance, you most likely don't want to pause all of them.  You can scope the pause to a virtual server by setting $app_name in the server directive of the virtual host:

    server {
      # Stick the app name in an nginx variable for use with intermission.
      # Since we want it set for all of the app requests, set it at the 
      # server level.
      set $app_name <%= @app_name %>; 

      # ... rest of config ...
     }

### Customizing Intermission's Behavior

What if your health check isn't at `/up`? Simply override the $intermission\_health\_check\_path in the nginx config.  What if you want a longer max pause time?  Override $intermission\_max\_time in the nginx config.  What if there's an external service like Pingdom and you always want their checks to succeed? Override $intermission\_privileged\_user\_agent in the nginx config:

     server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  localhost;

        location / {
          error_log  logs/intermission-error.log debug;
          set $intermission_max_time 300; #seconds
          set $intermission_health_check_path /up/database;
          set $intermission_privileged_user_agent "Pingdom";
          access_by_lua_file intermission/intermission.lua;
          proxy_pass http://google.com;
        }
        # Hit /_intermission/[status,disable,enable]
        location /_intermission {
          content_by_lua_file intermission/intermission_helpers.lua;
        }
    }
